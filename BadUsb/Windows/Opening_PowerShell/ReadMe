The scripts Iâ€™ve created serve as diagnostic tools to identify and test the various ways to open PowerShell on a device. 
These scripts do not execute or trigger other scripts but are designed specifically to evaluate the accessibility of PowerShell through different methods. 
This approach ensures that if one method of opening PowerShell is disabled or restricted, other potential avenues can be tested to determine which ones remain available. 
The key methods these scripts focus on include launching PowerShell via the Windows Run dialog, File Explorer, Task Manager, and the Start menu.

The primary purpose of these scripts is to help assess the system's configuration and identify possible restrictions or policies that may prevent certain methods of opening PowerShell. 
For instance, administrative or group policies might block PowerShell from being accessed through the Start menu, but the Run dialog or File Explorer may still provide a functional pathway. 
By testing each method independently, these scripts make it easy to pinpoint which methods are operational and which ones are restricted.

This functionality is especially useful in scenarios where a script or administrative command needs to be run on the device, but the standard method of launching PowerShell is unavailable. 
These scripts allow for a systematic examination of the system, ensuring that you can always find an accessible method to open PowerShell and proceed with executing necessary commands or scripts.
